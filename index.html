    <h2>1. Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of this project is to design an engineering solution that reduces food waste in grocery stores
      through a smart shelving system that uses sensors and data analytics to optimize inventory management.

    <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling a rectangular plate in SolidWorks under plane stress conditions.</li>
      <li>Testing various thicknesses (5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm) to analyze deformation.</li>
      <li>Defining material properties such as Young’s Modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and boundary conditions.</li>
      <li>Simulating uniform traction loads to evaluate structural response.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="results">
    <h2>3. Preliminary Results</h2>
    <p>
      The simulation showed that increasing plate thickness significantly reduces displacement and stress concentrations,
      validating the use of thicker materials for improved load-bearing capacity. Future analysis will include dynamic
      loading and fatigue response.

    <h2>4. Discussion & Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      The next phase will extend the 2D plane-stress model into a 3D analysis to incorporate bending effects.
      Experimental validation will be performed using MATLAB scripts to compare theoretical and numerical results.
